# kidney_training
This reprository includes:
* kidney disease data set with 400 observations and 26 features
* Jupyter Notebook with EDA, pre-processing, and Modelling steps
* Requirements file

The results indicated that RFC and xGBoost models perform very good at such problems. Further work is recommended since there's multicollinearity between features as indicated by VIFs score.
